# MCAL : Minecraft Command Abstraction Layer

##Introduction
MCAL exists to make sure your brain doesn't break when you code complex behavior.

## Project Structure
MCAL requires a runtime, which the source code is found in the `datapack` folder.

MCAL's compiler's source code is located within the `compiler` folder. The CLI is not finished yet, however it will be run from the `mclc.py` script.

VSCode doesn't support MCAL natively, so an extension to provide syntax highlighting for VSCode is available under the folder `vscode_extension`

Test MCAL scripts are located under the `tests` folder.

Documentation such as the language specification are located under the `doc` folder.
